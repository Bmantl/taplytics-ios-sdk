## Dynamic Variables & Code Blocks

**To see and modify these variables or blocks on the dashboard, the app must be launched and this code containing the variable or block must be navigated to a least once.**

The code below is used to send the information of the variable or block to Taplytics, so it will appear on the dashboard.

### Dynamic Variables

Taplytics variables are values in your app that are controlled by experiments. Changing the values can update the content or functionality of your app. Variables are reusable between experiments and operate in one of two modes: synchronous or asynchronous.

#### Synchronous

Synchronous variables are guaranteed to have the same value for the entire session and will have that value immediately after construction. 

Due to the synchronous nature of the variable, if it is used before the experiments have been loaded from Taplytics servers (for example on the first launch of your app), it's value will be the default value rather than the value set for that experiment. This could taint the results of the experiment. In order to prevent this you can ensure that the experiments are loaded before using the variable. This can be done using the `propertiesLoadedCallback:` method, as an example: 

```objc
[Taplytics propertiesLoadedCallback:^(BOOL loaded) {
    [self loadTLVariables];
}];
```

Synchronous variables take two parameters in its constructor:

1. Variable name (String)
2. Default Value

The type of the variable is defined by the type of the Default Value, and can be a `NSString`, `NSNumber` or a `Boolean` casted to a `NSNumber`. 

For example, using a variable of type `String`, using its value to get the value of the variable:
```objc
TaplyticsVar* stringVar = [TaplyticsVar taplyticsSyncVarWithName:@"stringVar" defaultValue:@"string"];
NSString* string = (NSString*)stringVar.value;
```
 
Using a casted `Boolean` to a `NSNumber`:

```objc
TaplyticsVar* boolVar = [TaplyticsVar taplyticsSyncVarWithName:@"boolVar" defaultValue:@(YES)];
BOOL boolean = [(NSNumber*)boolVar.value boolValue];
```

#### Asynchronous

Asynchronous variables take care of insuring that the experiments have been loaded before returning a value. This removes any danger of tainting the results of your experiment with bad data. What comes with the insurance of using the correct value is the possibility that the value will not be set immediately. If the variable is constructed *before* the experiments are loaded, you won't have the correct value until the experiments have finished loading. If the experiments fail to load, then you will be given the default value, as specified in the variables constructor.

Asynchronous variables take three parameters in its constructor:

1. Variable name (String)
2. Default Value
3. TLVarBlock

Just as for synchronous variables the type of the variable is defined by the type of the default value, and can be a `NSString`, `NSNumber` or a `Boolean` casted to a `NSNumber`. 

For example, using a variable of type `NSNumber`:

```objc
// In your Interface
@property (nonatomic, strong) TaplyticsVar* tlVar;

// Using the variable in your code:
self.tlVar = [TaplyticsVar taplyticsVarWithName:@"numVar" defaultValue:@(1) updatedBlock:^(NSObject *value) {
    if (value) {
        NSNumber* num = (NSNumber*)value;
    }
}];
```

When the variable's value has been updated, the updated block will be called with that updated value. Note that we only store a weak refrence to your variables, for the updated block to work correctly you will need to store a strong refrence to the variable object.

#### Testing Dynamic Variables

When testing dynamic variables in live update mode you can change the values on the fly via the taplytics interface and you can switch variations with the shake menu on the device.

**Important Note:** When testing synchronous dynamic variables you must initialize the variable again to see the new value, as there are no callbacks which occur when the variable is updated with a new value.

This can be achieved by using a properties loaded callback. Here is an example for updating a label:

```objc
__weak id weakSelf = self;
[Taplytics propertiesLoadedCallback:^(BOOL loaded) {
    TaplyticsVar* var = [TaplyticsVar taplyticsSyncVarWithName:@"stringVar" defaultValue:@"defaultValue"];
    if (weakSelf && weakSelf.label) {
        weakSelf.label.text = var.value;
    }
}];
```

### Code Blocks

Similar to Dynamic Variables, Taplytics has an option for 'Code Blocks'. Code blocks are linked to Experiments through the Taplytics website very much the same way that Dynamic Variables are, and will be executed based on the configuration of the experiment through the Taplytics website. A Code Block is a callback that can be enabled or disabled depending on the variation. If enabled, the code within the callback will be executed. If disabled, the variation will not get the callback.

A Code Block can be used alongside as many other Code Blocks as you would like to determine a combination that yields the best results. Perhaps there are three different Code Blocks on one view. This means there could be 8 different combinations of Code Blocks being enabled / disabled on that view if you'd like.

Example Using Objective-C:

```objc
[Taplytics runCodeBlock:@"enableFeature" forBlock:^{
    // enable your feature here
}];
```

Example Using Swift: 

```swift
Taplytics.runCodeBlock("enableFeature", forBlock: {
    // enable your feature here
})
```
    
## Code Experiments (Deprecated)

#### Setup

To set up a code-based experiment in Taplytics, please refer to the [Taplytics code-based experiment docs](https://taplytics.com/docs/guides/code-experiments).

#### Usage

Taplytics automatically generates the base needed for your code experiment. Paste it into the relevant section of your app, and apply the variables as necessary.

*Note that the Dictionary of variables can be empty, if your app loads for the first time and is unable to download properties from Taplytics servers, the baseline block will be called with an empty Dictionary. This will  cause all your code variables to be null, it is good practice to set a default value as shown below.

#### Objective-C Experiments

For example, an experiment named "Code Experiment #1" with a baseline block, and two variation blocks. Within each block we can get a `numberValue` variable from the `variables` NSDictionary, variables can have a different values set for each variation.
    
```objc
[Taplytics runCodeExperiment:@"Code Experiment #1" withBaseline:^(NSDictionary *variableDic) {
    // code variables can be null
    NSNumber* numberValue = variableDic[@"numberValue"] ? variableDic[@"numberValue"] : @0; 
    // Insert baseline experiment code here
} variations:@{@"Variation 1": ^(NSDictionary *variableDic) {
    // code variables can be null
    NSNumber* numberValue = variableDic[@"numberValue"] ? variableDic[@"numberValue"] : @1; 
    // Insert Variation 1 variation code here
}, @"Variation 2": ^(NSDictionary *variableDic) {
    // code variables can be null
    NSNumber* numberValue = variableDic[@"numberValue"] ? variableDic[@"numberValue"] : @2; 
    // Insert Variation 2 variation code here
}}];
```

#### Swift Experiments

Due to how blocks/closures are handled in Swift, passing blocks/closures in an NSDictioary as we do in `runCodeExperiment:withBaseline:variations:` is not well supported. The `runCodeExperiment:forBaseline:forVariation:` method handles the same functionality for Swift code.

For example the same code experiment in Objective-C from above, using Swift:

```swift
Taplytics.runCodeExperiment("Code Experiment #1",
    forBaseline: { variables in
        let numberValue: NSNumber? = variables?["numberValue"] as? NSNumber // can be null
        // Insert baseline experiment code here
    },
    forVariation: { variationName, variables in
        let numberValue: NSNumber? = variables?["numberValue"] as? NSNumber // can be null
        if variationName == "Variation 1" {
            // Insert Variation 1 variation code here
        }
        else if variationName == "Variation 2" {
            // Insert Variation 2 variation code here
        }
    }
)
```

#### Previewing Code Experiments

Implementing the TaplyticsDelegate is not necessary to properly run code-based experiments in a live environment, but with code experiments you will only see the changes when the runCodeExperiment block is executed. This means that when you are in a development environment and you switch between variations, you might not see changes until the view has been reloaded. If you would like to see these changes when you change variations (for example when you shake a development build to pull up the Taplytics Menu and choose a variation to test), you will have to implement the TaplyticsDelegate.

1. Add the TaplyticsDelegate to your Class

    ```objc
    #import <Taplytics/Taplytics.h>
    @interface SampleViewController : ViewController <TaplyticsDelegate>
    ```
2. Add the `taplyticsExperimentChanged:experimentName:variationName:` method to your Class and register the delegate with Taplytics using `setTaplyticsDelegate:`. Then call your code experiment again from that method. This delegate method will be called everytime the current variation is changed on the website or the shake menu.

    ```objc
    - (void)viewDidLoad {
        [super viewDidLoad];
        [Taplytics setTaplyticsDelegate:self];
        [self runMyCodeExperiment];
    }
    
    - (void)runMyCodeExperiment {
        [Taplytics runCodeBlock:@"enableFeature" forBlock:^{
            // enable your feature here
        }];
    }
    
    // TaplyticsDelegate
    - (void)taplyticsExperimentChanged:(NSString*)experimentName variationName:(NSString*)variationName {
        [self runMyCodeExperiment];
    }
    ```
---

## Testing Specific Experiments

To test/QA specific experiment and varation combinations use the `TaplyticsOptionTestExperiments` start option with a  `NSDictionary` containing keys of the experiment names, and values of variation names (or `baseline`).

```objc
[Taplytics startTaplyticsAPIKey:@"API_KEY" options:@{
    TaplyticsOptionTestExperiments: @{
        @"Experiment 1": @"Variation 1",
        @"Experiment 2": @"baseline"
    }
}];
```

---

## Visual Editing
You don't have to do anything else! You can use the Taplytics dashboard to make all your visual changes. See the docs on visual editing [here](https://taplytics.com/docs/guides/visual-experiments).

---

## Delay Load

On the first launch of your app, the Taplytics SDK will show your iOS launch image up to a maximum 4 seconds while it downloads properties from Taplytics servers. This delay will enable you to run experiments in the first view of your app.

If you would like to disable showing the launch image:

```obc
[Taplytics startTaplyticsAPIKey:@"Your_App_Token_Here" options:@{@"delayLoad":@0}];
```

Or increase the maximum wait time to 10 seconds:

```obc
[Taplytics startTaplyticsAPIKey:@"Your_App_Token_Here" options:@{@"delayLoad":@10}];
```

---

## Running Experiments

If you would like to see which variations and experiments are running on a given device, there exists a `getRunningExperimentsAndVariations()` function which provides a callback with the current experiments and their running variation. An example:

```obc
[Taplytics getRunningExperimentsAndVariations:^(NSDictionary *experimentsAndVariations) {
    // For example: 
    // NSDictionary* experimentsAndVariations = @{
    //  @"Experiment 1": @"baseline",
    //  @"Experiment 2": @"Variation 1"
    //};
}];
```
NOTE: The block can return asynchronously once Taplytics properties have loaded. The block will return a `NSDictionary` with experiment names as the key value, and variation names as the value.
