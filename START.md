You can get started with using Taplytics on iOS in minutes. Just follow the steps below:

| # | Step |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | [Install & Initialize Taplytics](#1-install) |
| 2 | [Setting User Attributes](#2-user-attributes) (optional) |
| 3 | [Tracking Events](#3-track-events) (optional) |

## 1. Install

### SDK

First, you'll want to install our SDK inside your XCode project.

#### CocoaPods Installation
1. Install using CocoaPods
    - Add a `Podfile` to the root of your project directory with the following:

        ```ruby
        platform :ios, '7.0'
        pod 'Taplytics'
        ```

    - Run pod install:
    
        ```
        pod install
        ```
    
    - Open your project's .xcworkspace file
    
2. Initialize the SDK by adding an import and the following line of code with your API key to your `UIApplicationDelegate`.

    
    ```objc
    #import <Taplytics/Taplytics.h>


    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
        ...
        [Taplytics startTaplyticsAPIKey:@"Your_App_Token_Here"];
        ...
    }
    ```

#### Manual Installation

1. [Download the SDK / clone into your app.](https://github.com/taplytics/taplytics-ios-sdk)
2. Load the Taplytics framework into your app.
3. Add the required frameworks:
    
    ```
    CFNetwork.framework
    Security.framework
    CoreTelephony.framework
    SystemConfiguration.framework
    MobileCoreServices.framework
    JavaScriptCore.framework
    libicucore.dylib
    ```
    
4. Add the `-ObjC` Linker flag to your project settings.
5. Initialize the SDK by adding a line of code with your API key in your `UIApplicationDelegate`.
    
    ```objc
    #import <Taplytics/Taplytics.h>
    ...
    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
        ...
        [Taplytics startTaplyticsAPIKey:@"Your_App_Token_Here"];
        ...
    }
    ```
    
#### Install Using Segment
The Taplytics SDK can also be installed via Segment. You can find install instructions [here](https://taplytics.com/docs/segment-integration)

### App Linking

Secondly, (though, optionally) you can implement app linking, which will allow you to pair your device to Taplytics via a link sent by email or text. App Linking is an easy way for your team to pair any build of your app to Taplytics. 

1. First ensure that `application:openURL:` method is implemented in your `UIApplicationDelegate`

    ```objc
    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)app openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApp annotation:(id)ann {
        return NO;
    }
    ```
    
2. [Get your Taplytics URL Scheme from Taplytics' Settings](https://taplytics.com/dashboard)

    ![Image of URL Scheme](http://taplytics.com/assets/docs/install-sdk/url-scheme.png)
    
    
3. Add Taplytics URL Type in XCode's Build Info panel, with Identifier: com.taplytics, add your Taplytics URL Scheme from above.

## 2. User Attributes

It's possible to segment your users based on custom user attributes. To set this up, you need to make either the `user_id` or `email` unique to identify the user across multiple devices. Below is a list of standard custom fields you can send to Taplytics. There is also a `customData` field that allows you to send any custom data you have as a flat `NSDictionary` with `NSJSONSerialization` accepted values.

The possible fields are:

|Parameter  |Type         |
|---        |---          |
|email      |   NSString    |
|user_id    |   NSString    |
|firstName  |   NSString    |
|lastName   |   NSString    |
|name       |   NSString    |
|age        |   NSNumber    |
|gender     |   NSString    |
|customData |   NSDictionary |

For example:

```objc
[Taplytics setUserAttributes: @{
    @"user_id": @"testUser",
    @"name": @"Test User",
    @"email": @"test@taplytics.com",
    @"gender": @"female",
    @"age": @25,
    @"avatarUrl": @"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/497895869270618112/1zbNvWlD.png",
    @"customData": @{
        @"paidSubscriber": @YES,
        @"purchases": @3,
        @"totalRevenue": @42.42
    }
}];
```

### Resetting Users

Once a user logs out of your app, their User Attributes are no longer valid. You can reset their data by calling `resetUser:`, make sure you do not set any new user attributes until you receive the callback.


```objc
[Taplytics resetUser:^{
  // Finished User Reset
}];
```

## 3. Track Events

### Automatic Tracking

The following events and general information are automatically tracked by Taplytics and will appear on your dashboard.

- Push Notification Seen/Opened

#### External Analytics Sources

If you already have Analytics events instrumented with another Analytics source Taplytics will also automatically pull in the events from the following sources:

- [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/mobile/)
- [Flurry](https://developer.yahoo.com/analytics/)
- [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/)
- [Intercom](https://www.intercom.io/)

- [Crashlytics Ansers](http://try.crashlytics.com/answers/)
- [KISSMetrics](https://www.kissmetrics.com/products)
- [Heap](https://heapanalytics.com/)

#### Disabling Automatic Tracking

You can disable automatic tracking for any of the below constants by adding them to the disable array.

|Constant  |Description         |
|---        |---          |
|TaplyticsDisableTrackLocation | location tracking |
|TaplyticsDisableTrackSocialSignIn | social sign in access alert tracking |
|TaplyticsDisableTrackiAdInstallation |  app install from iAd    |
|TaplyticsDisableTrackPhotoLibraryAccess |   photo library access alert tracking |
|TaplyticsDisableSourceGoogleAnalytics | Google Analytics event tracking |
|TaplyticsDisableSourceFlurry | Flurry Analytics event tracking |
|TaplyticsDisableSourceMixpanel | Mixpanel Analytics event tracking |
|TaplyticsDisableSourceIntercom | Intercom event tracking |
|TaplyticsDisableSourceParse | Parse Analytics event tracking |
|TaplyticsDisableSourceApsalar | Apsalar Analytics event tracking |
|TaplyticsDisableSourceAdobe | Adobe Analytics event tracking |
|TaplyticsDisableSourceLocalytics | Localytics Analytics event tracking |
|TaplyticsDisableSourceCrashlytics | Crashlytics Answers Analytics event tracking |
|TaplyticsDisableSourceKISSMetrics | KISSMetrics Analytics event tracking |
|TaplyticsDisableSourceHeap | Heap Analytics event tracking |
|TaplyticsDisableUITableViewSW | UITableView tracking |
|TaplyticsDisableUICollectionViewSW | UICollectionView tracking |
|TaplyticsDisableUIPageViewSW | UIPageView tracking |
|TaplyticsDisableUIActionSheetSW | UIActionSheet tracking |
|TaplyticsDisableUIAlertViewSW | UIAlertView tracking |

For example:

```obc
[Taplytics startTaplyticsAPIKey:@"Your_App_Token_Here" options:@{@"disable":@[TaplyticsOptionTrackLocation]}];
```

#### Backgound Session Time

Taplytics automatically tracks sessions for you. The Taplytics SDK keeps track of the last activity timestamp in your app (app activity is considered a view change, button click, or Taplytics event logged), and when your app returns from background if the time since last activity is greater then 10 minutes we create a new session for you. If you would like the session background time something other then 10 minutes you can se it as a start option: 

```obc
[Taplytics startTaplyticsAPIKey:@"Your_App_Token_Here" options:@{TaplyticsOptionSessionBackgroundTime:@10}];
```

---

### Taplytics Events

You can also track your own custom Analytics events to Taplytics using the `logEvent:` methods:

```objc
[Taplytics logEvent:@"CustomEvent"];

// With NSNumber value and metaData
[Taplytics logEvent:@"CustomEvent" value:@42 metaData:@{@"userSubscribed":@YES}];

// Log Revenue
[Taplytics logRevenue:@"Purchase" value:@10.25 metaData:@{@"Item":@"blueSweater"}];
```

### Experiment Information Postbacks

If you choose to, the Taplytics SDK can also send the running Experiment/Variation information to a supported Analytics source. [Check out our docs](https://taplytics.com/docs/guides/third-party-integration-setup) for details.
