- [Taplytics Docs](https://taplytics.com/docs)

## Installation Instructions 
#### CocoaPods Installation
1. Install using CocoaPods
    - Add a `Podfile` to the root of your project directory with the following:

        ```ruby
        platform :ios, '7.0'
        pod 'Taplytics'
        ```

    - Run pod install:
    
        ```
        pod install
        ```
    
    - Open your project's .xcworkspace file
    
2. Initialize the SDK by adding an import and the following line of code with your API key to your `UIApplicationDelegate`.

    
    ```objc
    #import <Taplytics/Taplytics.h>


    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
        ...
        [Taplytics startTaplyticsAPIKey:@"Your_App_Token_Here"];
        ...
    }
    ```

#### Manual Installation

1. Download the SDK / clone into your app.
2. Load the Taplytics framework into your app.
3. Add the required frameworks:
    
    ```
    CFNetwork.framework
    Security.framework
    CoreTelephony.framework
    SystemConfiguration.framework
    MobileCoreServices.framework
    JavaScriptCore.framework
    libicucore.dylib
    ```
    
4. Add the `-ObjC` Linker flag to your project settings.
5. Initialize the SDK by adding a line of code with your API key in your `UIApplicationDelegate`.
    
    ```objc
    #import <Taplytics/Taplytics.h>
    ...
    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
        ...
        [Taplytics startTaplyticsAPIKey:@"Your_App_Token_Here"];
        ...
    }
    ```
    
#### App Linking

Optionally you can implement app linking, which will allow you to pair your device to Taplytics via a link sent through email or text. This will enable your team to easily pair any build of your app to Taplytics.

1. First ensure that `application:openURL:` method is implemented in your `UIApplicationDelegate`

    ```objc
    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)app openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApp annotation:(id)ann {
        return NO;
    }
    ```
    
2. [Get your Taplytics URL Scheme from Taplytics's Settings](https://taplytics.com/dashboard)

    ![Image of URL Scheme](http://taplytics.com/assets/docs/install-sdk/url-scheme.png)
    
3. Add Taplytics URL Type in XCode's Build Info panel, with Identifier: com.taplytics, add your Taplytics URL Scheme from above.

## Code Experiment Instructions

Taplytics not only lets you run visual experiments with no code needed, the SDK also offers a code-based solution to running experiments in your app.

Code Experiments allow you to run different variations of your app with simple code blocks. You can also set different variable values for each variation to be returned in the code blocks.

#### Objective-C Experiments

For example, an experiment named "Code Experiment #1" with a baseline block, and two variation blocks. Within each block we can get a `numberValue` variable from the `variables` NSDictionary, variables can have a different values set for each variation.
    
```objc
[Taplytics runCodeExperiment:@"Code Experiment #1" withBaseline:^(NSDictionary *variables) {
    NSNumber* numberValue = variables[@"numberValue"];
    // Insert baseline experiment code here
} variations:@{@"Variation 1": ^(NSDictionary *variables) {
    NSNumber* numberValue = variables[@"numberValue"];
    // Insert Variation 1 variation code here
}, @"Variation 2": ^(NSDictionary *variables) {
    NSNumber* numberValue = variables[@"numberValue"];
    // Insert Variation 2 variation code here
}}];
```

#### Swift Experiments

Due to how blocks/closures are handled in Swift, passing blocks/closures in an NSDictioary as we do in `runCodeExperiment:withBaseline:variations:` is not well supported. The `runCodeExperiment:forBaseline:forVariation:` method handles the same functionality for Swift code.

For example the same code experiment in Objective-C from above, using Swift:

```swift
Taplytics.runCodeExperiment("Code Experiment #1",
    forBaseline: { variables in
        let numberValue: NSNumber? = variables?["numberValue"] as? NSNumber
        // Insert baseline experiment code here
    },
    forVariation: { variationName, variables in
        let numberValue: NSNumber? = variables?["numberValue"] as? NSNumber
        if variationName == "Variation 1" {
            // Insert Variation 1 variation code here
        }
        else if variationName == "Variation 2" {
            // Insert Variation 2 variation code here
        }
    }
)
```
    
#### Testing Code Experiments

Implementing the TaplyticsDelegate is not necessary to properly run code-based experiments. But with code experiments you will only see the changes when the runCodeExperiment block is actually excecuted, so when you switch between variations you might not see changes until the view has been reloaded. If you would like to see these changes when you change variations (for example when you shake a development build and choose a different variation to test), you will have to implement the TaplyticsDelegate.

1. Add the TaplyticsDelegate to your Class

    ```objc
    #import <Taplytics/Taplytics.h>
    @interface SampleViewController : ViewController <TaplyticsDelegate>
    ```
2. Add the `taplyticsExperimentChanged:experimentName:variationName:` method to your Class and register the delegate with Taplytics using `setTaplyticsDelegate:`. Then call your code experiment again from that method. This delegate method will be called everytime the current variation is changed on the website or the shake menu.

    ```objc
    - (void)viewDidLoad {
        [super viewDidLoad];
        [Taplytics setTaplyticsDelegate:self];
        [self runMyCodeExperiment];
    }
    
    - (void)runMyCodeExperiment {
        [Taplytics runCodeExperiment:@"My Code Experiment" withBaseline:^(NSDictionary *variables) {
            //  Code for baseline
        } variations:@{@"variation 1": ^(NSDictionary *variables) {
            // Code for variation 1
        }}];
    }
    
    // TaplyticsDelegate
    - (void)taplyticsExperimentChanged:(NSString*)experimentName variationName:(NSString*)variationName {
        [self runMyCodeExperiment];
    }
    ```
    
## Analytics Events

#### Taplytics Events

Some events are automatically tracked by Taplytics and will appear on your dashboard. These events are:

- App Active/Background/Terminated
- View Appeared/Dissapeared
- Time on View
- Location Authorized/Denied
- Social Sign-in Authorized/Denied
- Social Share Authorized/Denied
- Photo Library Authorized/Denied
- Push Notification Authorized/Denied
- Push Notification Seen/Opened

You can track your own custom Analytics events to Taplytics using the `logEvent:` methods:

```objc
[Taplytics logEvent:@"CustomEvent"];
// With NSNumber value and metaData
[Taplytics logEvent:@"CustomEvent" value:@42 metaData:@{@"userSubscribed":@YES}];
// Log Revenue
[Taplytics logRevenue:@"Purchase" value:@10.25 metaData:@{@"Item":@"blueSweater"}];
```

#### Analytics Sources

If you already have Analytics events instrumented with another Analytics source Taplytics will automatically pull in the events from the following sources:

- [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/mobile/)
- [Flurry](https://developer.yahoo.com/analytics/)
- [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/)
- [Intercom](https://www.intercom.io/)
- [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud.html)
- [Localytics](https://www.localytics.com/)
- [Parse](https://www.parse.com/)
- [Apsalar](https://apsalar.com/)

#### Push Experiment/Variation Information

If you choose to, the Taplytics SDK can also send the running Experiment/Variation information to a supported Analytics source. [Check out our docs](https://taplytics.com/docs/third-party-integration-setup) for details.

## User Attributes

Its possible to send user attributes to Taplytics for use in segmenting your users. It is required to set one of `user_id` or `email` to uniquely identify the user across multiple devices. The `customData` field allows you to send Taplytics your own custom data as a flat `NSDictionary` with `NSJSONSerialization` accepted values.

The possible fields are:

|Parameter  |Type         |
|---	    |---          |
|email	    |	NSString    |
|user_id    |	NSString    |
|firstname  |	NSString    |
|lastname   |	NSString    |
|name	    |	NSString    |
|age	    |	NSNumber    |
|gender	    |	NSString    |
|customData |	NSDictionary |

For example:

```objc
[Taplytics setUserAttributes: @{
    @"user_id": @"testUser",
    @"name": @"Test User",
    @"email": @"test@taplytics.com",
    @"gender": @"female",
    @"age": @25,
    @"avatarUrl": @"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/497895869270618112/1zbNvWlD.png",
    @"customData": @{
        @"paidSubscriber": @YES,
        @"purchases": @3,
        @"totalRevenue": @42.42
    }
}];
```

To reset a user after they have logged out of your app and the User Attributes are no longer valid, call `resetUser:`. Do not set any new user attributes until you receive the callback.

```objc
[Taplytics resetUser:^{
  // Finished User Reset
}];
```

## Push Notification Instructions

1. In order for iOS and Taplytics to know that your app accepts Push Notifications, you must implement the following methods on your  `UIApplicationDelegate`.

    ```objc
    // Implement these methods for Taplytics Push Notifications
    - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application
    didRegisterUserNotificationSettings:(UIUserNotificationSettings *)notificationSettings {
    }
     
    - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken {
    }
     
    - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError *)error {
    }
     
    - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo {
    }
     
    - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo
    fetchCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult))completionHandler {
    completionHandler(UIBackgroundFetchResultNoData);
    }
    ```
    
2. You'll also need to register for push notifications with iOS. When you do so, iOS will ask your users for permission and enable the ability to receive notifications to that device.

    If you are not already registering for push notifications all you have to do is call registerPushNotifications: on Taplytics, and we take care of all the rest!

    Please note that calling this function will show the permission dialog to the user.
    
    ```objc
    /* Example usage */
    [Taplytics registerPushNotifications];
    ```
    
#### Resetting User After Logout

If you're using our User Attributes feature, you can easily disconnect a user from the device when they log out. This will prevent our system from sending pushes to that device if you attempt to send a targetted push notification to the user who used to be logged in on it. You can do this by calling our `resetUser:` function:

```objc
[Taplytics resetUser:^{
  // Finished User Reset
}];
```
